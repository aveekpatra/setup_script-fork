## üéØ Purpose of This Documentation

This documentation set serves multiple critical purposes:

### For Human Developers

- **Complete understanding** of the project architecture
- **Development guidelines** for consistent code quality
- **API reference** for all functions and data structures
- **Workflow guidance** for efficient development

### For AI Assistants (Cursor, etc.)

- **Prevent hallucination** of non-existent files or functions
- **Ensure accurate understanding** of project structure
- **Provide verified facts** about implementation details
- **Guide proper development** following established patterns

## üö® Critical Understanding Points

### This is a Generator Tool

- **NOT** a simple website project
- **Generates** casino websites using templates
- **Main functionality** is in `starter.py` (720 lines)
- **Output** goes to `web-folder/` directory

### Template System Facts

- Each component has **exactly 10 template variants**
- Templates use **specific comment syntax** for extraction
- **Regex patterns** are used for template parsing
- **Processing order** is fixed and critical

### File Structure Facts

- `web-components/` = **source templates**
- `web-folder/` = **generated output**
- `master/` = **country-specific content**
- `scripts-folder/` = **placeholder scripts (empty)**

### Country Support

- **Confirmed countries**: Denmark, France, Portugal, UK-IR
- **Footer support**: Denmark, France, Portugal, UK-IR, Croatia, Argentina
- **Offers support**: Denmark, France, Portugal, UK-IR only
